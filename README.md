## Why foundry-mcp?

**The problem:** AI coding assistants are powerful but unreliable on complex tasks. They lose context mid-feature, skip steps without warning, and deliver inconsistent results across sessions.

**The solution:** foundry-mcp provides the scaffolding to break work into specs, track progress, and verify outputs—so your AI assistant delivers like a professional engineer.

- **No more lost context** — Specs persist state across sessions so the AI picks up where it left off.
- **No more skipped steps** — Task dependencies and blockers ensure nothing gets missed.
- **No more guessing progress** — See exactly what's done, what's blocked, and what's next.
- **No more manual review** — AI review validates implementation against spec requirements.

## Key Features

- **Specs keep AI on track** — Break complex work into phases and tasks the AI can complete without losing context.
- **Progress you can see** — Track what's done, what's blocked, and what's next across multi-session work.
- **AI-powered review** — LLM integration reviews specs, generates PR descriptions, and validates implementation.
- **Works with your tools** — Runs as MCP server (Claude Code, Gemini CLI) or standalone CLI with JSON output.
- **Security built in** — Workspace scoping, API key auth, rate limits, and audit logging ship by default.
- **Discovery-first** — Capabilities declared in a manifest so clients negotiate features automatically.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- MCP-compatible client (e.g., Claude Code)

### Install with uvx (recommended)

```bash
uvx foundry-mcp
```

### Install with pip

```bash
pip install foundry-mcp
```

### Install from source (development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tylerburleigh/foundry-mcp.git
cd foundry-mcp
pip install -e ".[test]"
```

## Quick Start

**1. Install the claude-foundry plugin** (from within Claude Code):

```
/plugin marketplace add foundry-works/claude-foundry
/plugin install foundry@claude-foundry
```

Restart Claude Code and trust the repository when prompted.

> **Note:** The plugin automatically registers the MCP server using `uvx` — no separate installation needed.

**2. Run setup:**

```
Please run foundry-setup to configure the workspace.
```

**3. Start building:**

```
I want to add user authentication with JWT tokens.
```

Claude creates a spec with phases, tasks, and verification steps. Ask to implement and it works through tasks in dependency order.

## How It Works

foundry-mcp is the **MCP server** that provides the underlying tools and APIs. The [claude-foundry](https://github.com/foundry-works/claude-foundry) plugin provides the **user-facing skills** that orchestrate workflows.

```
You → Claude Code → claude-foundry plugin → foundry-mcp server
         │                  │                      │
         ▼                  ▼                      ▼
      Natural          Skills like            MCP tools for
      language         foundry-spec,          specs, tasks,
      requests         foundry-implement      reviews, etc.
```

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **foundry-mcp** | MCP server + CLI providing spec/task/review tools |
| **claude-foundry** | Claude Code plugin providing skills and workflow |

For most users, install both and interact through natural language. The plugin handles tool orchestration automatically.

## Configuration

### API Keys

foundry-mcp uses LLM providers for AI-powered features like spec review, consensus, and deep research. Set the API keys for providers you want to use:

```bash
# AI CLI tools (for AI review, consensus)
export CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN="..."   # Get via: claude setup-token
export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export CURSOR_API_KEY="key-..."

# Deep research providers (for /foundry-research deep workflow)
export TAVILY_API_KEY="..."
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="..."
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="..."
export GOOGLE_CSE_ID="..."
```

### TOML Configuration (Optional)

For advanced settings, copy the sample config to your project:

```bash
cp samples/foundry-mcp.toml ./foundry-mcp.toml
```

## Advanced Usage

### Direct MCP Configuration (without plugin)

For MCP clients other than Claude Code, or if you prefer manual configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "foundry-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["foundry-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FOUNDRY_MCP_SPECS_DIR": "/path/to/specs"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary>Using a pip installation instead?</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "foundry-mcp": {
      "command": "foundry-mcp",
      "env": {
        "FOUNDRY_MCP_SPECS_DIR": "/path/to/specs"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

### CLI Usage

All MCP tools are also available via CLI with JSON output:

```bash
# Get next task to work on
python -m foundry_mcp.cli task next --specs-dir ./specs

# Validate a spec
python -m foundry_mcp.cli spec validate my-feature-001

# Create a new spec
python -m foundry_mcp.cli authoring create --name "my-feature" --template detailed
```

### Launch as Standalone MCP Server

```bash
foundry-mcp
```

The server advertises its capabilities, feature flags, and response contract so MCP clients (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.) can connect automatically.

## Scope and Limitations

**Best for:**
- Multi-step feature development with AI assistants
- Teams wanting structured handoff between AI and human reviewers
- Projects requiring audit trails and progress visibility

**Not suited for:**
- Quick one-off code changes (use your AI assistant directly)
- Non-software tasks (specs are code-focused)
- Fully autonomous AI agents (foundry assumes human oversight)

## Testing

```bash
pytest                                        # Full suite
pytest tests/integration/test_mcp_smoke.py    # MCP smoke tests
pytest tests/integration/test_mcp_tools.py    # Tool contract coverage
```

- Regression tests keep MCP/CLI adapters aligned across surfaces.
- Golden fixtures (`tests/fixtures/golden`) ensure response envelopes, error semantics, and pagination never regress.
- Freshness checks run alongside core unit and integration suites.
