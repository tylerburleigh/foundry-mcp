However, a critical structural issue blocks phase completion: all generators are located in the installed package directory (src/claude_skills/) rather than the development source directory (skills/llm-doc-gen/). This mismatch prevents the pending verification task (task-3-6) from completing. Resolving this file location issue (estimated 45 minutes) will allow phase-3 to reach 100% completion and unblock Phase-4."
