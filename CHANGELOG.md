# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Spec Field Requirements**: Medium/complex specs now require `metadata.mission` and task metadata for `task_category`, `description`, and `acceptance_criteria`; implementation/refactoring tasks must include `file_path`.
- **Task Metadata Updates**: `task update-metadata` now accepts `acceptance_criteria` and aligns task category validation with the canonical spec categories.

## [0.4.1] - 2025-12-24

### Added

- **Batch Metadata Utilities**: New task actions for bulk operations
  - `task action=metadata-batch`: Apply metadata updates to multiple nodes with AND-based filtering by `node_type`, `phase_id`, or `pattern` regex
  - `task action=fix-verification-types`: Auto-fix invalid/missing verification types on verify nodes with legacy mapping support
  - Both actions support `dry_run` mode for previewing changes
- **Phase-First Authoring**: New `authoring action=phase-add-bulk` for creating multiple phases at once with metadata defaults
- **Spec Mission Field**: Added `mission` field to spec metadata schema for concise goal statements
- **Workflow Timeout Override**: AI consultation now supports workflow-specific timeout configuration

### Changed

- **JSON Output Optimization**: CLI and MCP server now emit minified JSON (no indentation) for smaller payloads
- **Fidelity Review Improvements**: Better path resolution with workspace_root support, graceful handling of non-JSON provider responses
- **Provider Configuration**: Updated OpenCode model IDs and default model; reordered provider priority
- **Claude Provider Tests**: Updated to use Haiku model for faster test execution

### Fixed

- Fixed parameter filtering in error_list handler to prevent unexpected argument errors
- Fixed duplicate file paths in fidelity review implementation artifacts
- Synced `__init__.py` version with `pyproject.toml`

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-23

### Changed

- **Verification Types**: Aligned task API and spec validator to use canonical values (`run-tests`, `fidelity`, `manual`)
  - Task API now accepts `run-tests`, `fidelity`, `manual` (previously `auto`, `manual`, `none`)
  - Spec validator updated to match canonical schema values
  - Legacy values automatically mapped: `test` → `run-tests`, `auto` → `run-tests`

### Added

- **Auto-fix for `INVALID_VERIFICATION_TYPE`**: Specs with legacy verification types are now auto-fixable via `validate-fix`
- **Auto-fix for `INVALID_ROOT_PARENT`**: Specs where spec-root has non-null parent are now auto-fixable

### Removed

- Removed `foundry-mcp-ctl` package and mode-toggling feature - server now always runs with all tools registered

## [0.3.4] - 2025-12-21

_Note: Mode toggling features added in this version were subsequently removed._

## [0.3.3] - 2025-12-17

### Changed
- **Dashboard**: Refactored pages module to views with cleaner organization
- **Dashboard**: Improved data stores with better caching and filtering
- **Observability**: Added action label to tool metrics for router-level granularity
- **Providers**: Codex CLI now ignores unsupported parameters (warning instead of error)

### Added
- Dashboard PID file tracking for cross-CLI process management
- Tool usage dashboard view with action-level breakdown
- OpenCode Node.js wrapper for subprocess execution
- Integration tests for provider smoke testing, fidelity review flow, and plan review flow

### Fixed
- Codex provider environment handling (unsets OPENAI_API_KEY/OPENAI_BASE_URL that interfere with CLI)
- Minor fixes to Claude and Gemini providers

## [0.3.2] - 2025-12-16

### Added
- Launcher script (`bin/foundry-mcp`) for configurable Python interpreter selection
- `FOUNDRY_MCP_PYTHON` environment variable to override the default Python interpreter

### Fixed
- Removed duplicate `spec_id` and `node_id` fields from task progress response

## [0.3.1] - 2025-12-16

### Removed
- Removed `code` unified tool (find-class, find-function, callers, callees, trace, impact actions) from MCP surface. Unified manifest reduced from 17 to 16 tools.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-15

### Changed
- Consolidated the MCP tool surface into 17 unified routers (tool + `action`) and aligned CLI/MCP naming.
- Updated documentation and manifests to reflect the unified router contract.

### Added
- New completed specs documenting MCP tool consolidation and removal of docquery/rendering/docgen.
- Unified-manifest budget telemetry (Prometheus metrics, recording rules, alerting rules, and dashboard panels).

### Removed
- Legacy per-tool MCP modules and legacy CLI command surfaces in favor of unified routers.
- Docquery/rendering/docgen modules and generated docs previously under `docs/generated/`.

## [0.2.1] - 2025-12-08

### Changed
- **Dashboard**: Replaced aiohttp+vanilla JS dashboard with Streamlit for better visualizations and interactivity
- Dashboard dependencies changed from `aiohttp` to `streamlit`, `plotly`, `pandas`
- Default dashboard port changed from 8080 to 8501 (Streamlit default)

### Added
- New Streamlit dashboard with 5 pages: Overview, Errors, Metrics, Providers, SDD Workflow
- Interactive Plotly charts with zoom, pan, and hover tooltips
- Data export functionality (CSV/JSON download buttons)
- Cached data access via `@st.cache_data` for performance
- CLI commands: `dashboard start`, `dashboard stop`, `dashboard status`
- New SDD Workflow page for spec progress tracking, phase burndown, task status
- Plan review tool (`plan-review`) for AI-assisted specification review

### Removed
- Old aiohttp-based dashboard server and static JS/CSS files
