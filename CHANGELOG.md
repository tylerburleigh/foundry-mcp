All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.7.8] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed

- **Consensus Event Loop Conflict**: Fixed `asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop` error
  - Replaced `asyncio.run()` with `ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallel provider execution
  - Works correctly within MCP server's event loop context
  - New `_execute_parallel_sync()` and `_query_provider_sync()` methods for thread-based parallelism

- **Research Timeout Configuration**: Fixed thinkdeep and other workflows timing out after 30 seconds
  - Added `default_timeout` config option to `[research]` section (default: 60 seconds)
  - Workflows now use configurable timeout from config instead of hardcoded 30s
  - Longer-running investigation workflows like thinkdeep no longer timeout prematurely

## [0.7.7] - 2025-12-30

### Added

- **Research ProviderSpec Alignment**: Research config now supports full ProviderSpec notation like consultation
  - `default_provider` accepts both simple IDs (`"gemini"`) and ProviderSpec (`"[cli]gemini:gemini-2.5-flash"`)
  - `consensus_providers` accepts mixed notation for flexible model selection per provider
  - New `ResearchConfig.get_default_provider_spec()` helper parses default provider
  - New `ResearchConfig.get_consensus_provider_specs()` helper parses consensus providers
  - New `ProviderSpec.parse_flexible()` method for backward-compatible parsing
  - Workflows (`chat`, `consensus`, `thinkdeep`, `ideate`) now extract models from specs
  - Added `[research]` section to sample config with notation examples

## [0.7.6] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed

- **Research Tools Feature Flag**: Fixed bug where `research_tools = true` in `[features]` config section was ignored
  - Root cause 1: `research_tools` flag was never registered in the feature flag registry
  - Root cause 2: `[features]` section in TOML config was not being read
  - Added flag registration in `research.py` following `provider.py` pattern
  - Added global override support to `FeatureFlagRegistry` for config-based flag settings
  - Added `[features]` section handling in `ServerConfig._load_toml()`
  - Added `FOUNDRY_MCP_FEATURES` environment variable support (format: `flag1=true,flag2=false`)

### Added

- **Feature Flag Global Overrides**: New methods on `FeatureFlagRegistry`:
  - `set_global_override(flag_name, enabled)` - Set config-based override for all clients
  - `clear_global_override(flag_name)` - Clear a global override
  - `clear_all_global_overrides()` - Clear all global overrides
  - `apply_config_overrides(features)` - Apply multiple overrides from config dict

### Dependencies

- Added `filelock>=3.20.1` as a required dependency

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Consistent JSON Output**: Fixed inconsistent JSON formatting in MCP tool responses
  - Some tools returned pretty-printed JSON (indent=2), others returned minified JSON
  - Root cause: Unreliable monkey-patch of FastMCP's `_convert_to_content` function
  - Solution: Tools now serialize directly to minified JSON strings via new `to_json()` helper
  - All 17 unified tools updated to return consistent minified JSON output
  - Removed deprecated `_patch_fastmcp_json_serialization()` from server.py

- **AI Consultation Config Loading**: Fixed issue where AI consultation features returned `model_used: "none"` because config was loaded from CWD instead of workspace path
  - `review.py`: Now loads `foundry-mcp.toml` from workspace path for fidelity reviews
  - `plan.py`: Added `_find_config_file()` helper to walk up directories and find config

### Added

- **Provider Availability Caching**: Cache provider detection results to speed up MCP tool calls
  - New `[providers] availability_cache_ttl` config option (default: 3600 seconds)
  - Reduces repeated calls from ~5s to ~0s

### Changed

- **Provider Model Validation Removed**: Model allowlists removed from all CLI providers
  - Providers no longer pre-register or validate model IDs against hardcoded lists
  - Any model string is now passed through to the underlying CLI for validation
  - Eliminates sync issues when providers release new models
  - Affected providers: `claude`, `gemini`, `codex`, `cursor-agent`
  - Default models remain as fallbacks: opus, pro, gpt-5.2, composer-1

- **BREAKING: Simplified Spec Templates**: Removed pre-baked spec templates (simple, medium, complex, security)
  - Only `empty` template is now supported - creates a blank spec with no phases
  - Use phase templates (`planning`, `implementation`, `testing`, `security`, `documentation`) to add structure
  - Default template changed from `medium` to `empty`
  - Mission statement no longer required (was required for medium/complex)
  - `_requires_rich_task_fields()` now checks explicit `complexity` metadata instead of template
  - Passing deprecated templates (simple, medium, complex, security) returns validation error

### Migration

```python
# Old approach (no longer works)
authoring(action="spec-create", name="my-feature", template="medium", mission="...")

# New approach
authoring(action="spec-create", name="my-feature")
authoring(action="phase-template", template_action="apply", template_name="planning", spec_id="...")
authoring(action="phase-template", template_action="apply", template_name="implementation", spec_id="...")
